This list is by no means exhaustive. I have left out countless amazing resources, researchers, etc.

## Papers
I store all my papers on Zotero. I've yet to decide what I think are the most important of the hundreds of papers I've looked at, but will list them at some stage.

## Researchers
* [John P. Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/) - Pushing the field of ensemble theory forward through arguments and simulations.

* [Rafael Yuste](http://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/rmy5/) - Focus on neural ensembles and testing them using optogenetics.

* [Johnathon Pillow](http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/index.html) - Modelling, characterising neural pop responses, and extracting structure from high dim responses.

* [Miguel Nicolelis](https://www.nicolelislab.net/) - Mostly in BMI and neuroprosthetics, but was one of the OG people looking at neural ensembles and inter-regional communication as he was using to make BMIs.

* [Juan Gallego](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8ss6egkAAAAJ&hl=en) - Does a lot of work on dimension reduction using manifolds.

* [Gyorgy Buszaki](https://buzsakilab.com/wp/buzsaki/) - Arguably the best electrophysiologist out there. Specifically, his work with David Tingley and his self authored publications tend to share wide ranging views on brain function and are very interesting.

* [Marcus Raichle](https://sites.wustl.edu/nillabs/people/marcus-e-raichle/) - Default mode, "dark energy", and propagation of signals. FMRI mostly.

* [Martin Vinck](http://martinvinck.com/index.html) - Mostly focused on the visual system, so not all is relevant - but has good views on statistics more generally.

Some from Mark Humphries blog are:
Johnathan Pillow; Christian Machens; Konrad Kording; Kanaka Rajan; John Cunningham; Adrienne Fairhall; Philip Berens; Cian Oâ€™Donnell; Il Memming Park; Jakob Macke; Gasper Tkacik; Oliver Marre. Um, me. Others are experimental labs with strong data science inclinations: Anne Churchland; Mark Churchland; Nicole Rust; Krishna Shenoy; Carlos Brody.

## Journals
* [Software Journals](https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software)
* [Quora List](https://www.quora.com/Which-scientific-journals-are-relevant-to-neuroscience)

## Conferences
* [Bernstein Compuational Neuroscience](https://www.bernstein-network.de/en/start_page)
* [Computational and Systems Neuroscience](http://www.cosyne.org/c/index.php?title=Cosyne_20)
* [UK Neural Computation Conference](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/uknc20/home)
* [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/)

## Books
* [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/ed4) - freely available textbook with the source openly available on GitHub.
* [Neuroscience Online](https://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/toc.htm) - free online basic neuroscience book by the University of Texas.
* [Statistics Done Wrong](https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/) - a guide to the most popular statistical errors and slip-ups, with the replication crisis and I would argue that many of these are more well known than at the time of writing.
* [Methods for Neural Ensemble Recordings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1985/) - early book edited by Nicolelis.
* [Theoretical Neuroscience](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dayan/book/) - famous book by Dayan and Abbott.

## Blogs
* [The Spike](https://medium.com/the-spike) - Mark Humphries blog on neural data analysis and more.

## Podcasts
* [Brain Inspired](https://braininspired.co/) - Paul Middlebrooks fantastic podcast on AI and Neuroscience and their overlap.
* [Brain Science](https://brainsciencepodcast.com/) - Virginia Campbell's podcast, most recent 50 episodes are free.
* [Brain Matters](https://brainpodcast.com/tagged/episodes) - University of Texas at Austin podcast on neuroscience.

## Websites
* [Awesome Neuroscience](https://github.com/analyticalmonk/awesome-neuroscience) - another list of great resources, likely to be some overlap.
* [Computational Neuroscience Researchers](https://github.com/eselkin/awesome-computational-neuroscience#germany) - a list of comp neuro researchers.
* [Open Computational Neuroscience Resources](https://github.com/asoplata/open-computational-neuroscience-resources) - a comprehensive list of resources on GitHub.

## Software
* [Raphael Vallat](https://github.com/raphaelvallat) - in particular, pingouin is a stats library with more detail than scipy provides, and entropy is a time-series complexity evaluator.
* [LFPy](https://lfpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ) - simulation from neuron models.

## Courses
* [Data Analysis in Python](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663-2017/) - a good Duke University guide to programming in Python, covers basic and complex topics, such as parallelism and just in time compilation.

## Groups
* [The BRAIN Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/) - study how individual brain cells and complex neural circuits interact.
* [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/).

## Miscellaneous
* [Chicago Leadership Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM) - The craft of writing effectively, and also the writing beyond the academy lectures.
