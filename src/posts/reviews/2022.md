<td><strong>Before Your Eyes</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>Amazing experience, very moving. The idea of controlling with eye blinks is very novel. </td>
</tr>

<tbody>
<td><strong>Elden Ring</strong> (PS5)</td>
<td>★★★★★</td>
<td>Fantastic game, really enjoyed the almost 100 hour playtrough. The combat, visuals, story etc. come together really nicely, it is great. </td>

<td>A really cute game about taking pictures :) </td>

## Movies and TV shows watched

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Movie</th>
<th>Rating</th>
<th>Note</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Interstellar</strong> (2014)</td>
<td>★★★★★</td>
<td>Murph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Imitation Game</strong> (2014)</td>
<td>★★★★★</td>
<td>Fantastic movie. A little bittersweet due to the misrepresenation of some real life characters though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Batman</strong> (2022)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>Brilliantly made movie, but it is extremely grim. Feels a bit like playing power grid, is it really fun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Moon Knight</strong> (2022)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>Very well made, moving character lines. The inclusion of the Egyptian gods is pretty cool too. Something about it felt slightly off, but it is good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Only Murders in the Building</strong> (2021)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>Actually really good! Some of the humour is a bit off I think, but overall a great mix of real suspense and genuinely good comedy. </td>

## Books read

<table>

<th>Note</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Sparkling Cyanide - Christie</strong> (1944)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>A thrilling read, everyone has motives. Probably not the most interesting of Christie's works, but a very strong one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Spike - Humphries</strong> (2021)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>A very solid account of how spikes are formed and what they enable, with well placed humour so that you are not just reading a text book.</td>
</tr>
