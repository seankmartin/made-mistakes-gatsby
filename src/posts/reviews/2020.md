<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Sekiro</strong> (PS4)</td>
<td>★★★★★</td>
<td>Amazing game, incredibly smooth combat. Completed it three times, but still have nightmares about monkeys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Bloodborne</strong> (PS4)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>A great game, but framerate issues, some unsatisfying bosses, and lack of diversity keeps it from 5 stars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Darksiders Genesis</strong> (PS4)</td>
<td>★★★☆☆</td>
<td>Fun combat but extremely repetitive with uninteresting puzzles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>FIFA 17</strong> (PS4)</td>
<td>★★★☆☆</td>
<td> Hilarious story mode that would have been genuinely fun if it wasn't so drawn out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Oxygen Not Included</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★★☆☆</td>
<td> Fun, but very frustrating and a large time sink.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Deep Rock Galactic</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td> Rock and stone brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Shards of Infinity</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★★☆☆</td>
<td> Might be four stars if I didn't like Ascension so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Astroneer</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td> Extremely fun game loop, but the game feels unfinished and is broken in multiplayer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Disco Elysium</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★★☆☆</td>
<td> Starts strong, finishes weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★★☆☆</td>
<td>Would have been great if it was not so drawn out. The story is fantastic but the battles are trivial, yet very long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Littlewood</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>An absolute blast at the start, but the game gets grindy faster than desired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>XCOM 2</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>Amazing strategy game that carries weight with every action taken. Would recommend turning on settings to speed up the game and installing some quality of life mods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Middle-earth: Shadow of War</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★☆☆☆</td>
<td>I can't help but feel I've played this all before in Shadow of Mordor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Islanders</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>Fun minimalistic building game at a low price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Monster Hunter: World</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★★★☆</td>
<td>Amazing fights with equally amazing monsters, pity the story is so bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Hades</strong> (PC)</td>
<td>★★★★★</td>
<td>Incredibly fun roguelike, can't wait for the full release of the game.</td>
</tr>
