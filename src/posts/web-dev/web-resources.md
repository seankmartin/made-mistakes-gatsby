## List of Tools
- **Git and GitHub**: Host the static code.
- **Staticman and Heroku**: Host a GitHub bot account which pushes comments to this website's GitHub repository.
- **ReCaptcha**: Hopefully stop spam (hello robots).
- **Formspree**: Host a contact page without me having to worry about it.
- **Gatsby**: Build the website.
- **Netlify**: Host the website built with Gatsby.
- **Nice Humans**: Particular thanks to [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-gatsby) but overall a set of amazing tools, documentation, blog posts, books, talks etc. made this possible - thank you all!
