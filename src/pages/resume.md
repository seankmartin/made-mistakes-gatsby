I am a keen mathematician and computer scientist, currently a research assistant in Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience and a PhD candidate.

## Experience

### Research Assistant (Sept 2018 - Present)
**Research Assistant**
I am working with the neuroscience department, bringing my maths and computing skills to the team. This involves myriad responsibilities, including developing data analysis tools, creating a python application with a GUI for the analysis, and programming microcontrollers for experiments.

I have also developed an experiment in Unreal Engine 4 for the Science Gallery Dublin to investigate the relationship between humans and digital humans in a virtual reality setting. In addition, I have presented a paper on deep learning at the GRAPP 2019 conference, and I chaired a session on rendering at the conference.
